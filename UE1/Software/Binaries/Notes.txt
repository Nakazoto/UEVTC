UE1MATH.BIN
     A simple math program that adds or subtracts two 6-bit numbers
     The program is copied in triplicate on the binary
     This is to make it long enough for a good paper tape loop on the machine
     In total, there are 464 bytes, and the tape should be 46.4 inches
     (Excluding leader and trailer)

UE1FIBO.BIN
     A simple program that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to 21
     This program is alone on the tape and is therefore a little too short
     In total, there are 202 bytes, and the tape should be 20.2 inches
