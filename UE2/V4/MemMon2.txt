1. User types a four octal word, MUX supplies that word to HCR
2. Computer breaks word up like so: BBB BMM MMM MMM
     B: 4-bits for the EBNK register
     M: 8-bits for the memory address
3. Computer saves new EBNK value
4. Computer uses low 8-bits of HCR as memory address
5. Computer fills HCR with new memory value
6. Computer outputs that value to the user via MUX
7. User types a new four octal word, MUX supplies that word to HCR
8. Computer copies that word into memory at MAR
9. Computer outputs a carriage return to the user via MUX


Bank F = MMIO
     MUX Card
     F00 => Receive Status Bit
     F01 => Send Status Bit
     F02 => Receive Word
     F03 => Send Word
     F04 => Clear Receive Status Bit

; Set the bank so we can check the MMIO stuff
LDD  F00       ; Load F00 directly into the ACR
STM            ; Copy ACR into MAR
MTE            ; Copy MAR into EBK, sets bank to same level as this code

; Loop to check if a word has been received
SFL  000       ; Clear out flags
MIN  F00       ; Grab Receive Status Bit and put it in HCR
LDD  FFF       ; Load ACR with all 1's
ADC            ; Add ACR + HCR + LFL
BLF  003       ; Branch to top of this loop if Link Flag is set

; Word has been received, grab the bank from the word and store it for later
MIN  002       ; Copy word from MUX into HCR
LDI            ; Copy HCR into ACR
RLF            ; Rotate ACR left five times to put the
RLF            ; High nibble into the low nibble spot
RLF            ; We rotate five times because we're
RLF            ; using the Link register as an additional
RLF            ; in the rotate
STH            ; Copy ACR into HCR
LDD  000       ; Load all 0's directly into the ACR
STM            ; Copy ACR into MAR
MTE            ; Copy MAR into EBK, sets bank to same level as this code
LDD  0FF       ; Load the address in this bank we want to store HCR at
STM            ; Copy ACR into MAR
MOT            ; Copy HCR into Bank 0 at address FF (store EBK for later)
LDI            ; Copy HCR back into ACR
STM            ; Copy ACR into MAR, sets bank to what user requested
; Finally grab word and print it out for the user
