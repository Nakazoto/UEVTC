State Machine

00   Load value from MEM(@PCR) into OIR/AIR
          Wait for memory transfer done signal
01   If OIR = 111 jump to 05 otherwise continue
02   OIR execute step 1 (turn outputs on)
03   OIR execute step 2 (clock bus value into inputs)
04   Jump to 15
05   If AIR bit 0 = 1 jump to 09 otherwise continue
06   Move execute step 1 (turn source output on)
07   Move execute step 2 (clock bus value into destination)
08   Jump to 15
09   If AIR bit 1 = 1 jump to 12 otherwise continue
10   Load value from MEM(@MAR) into HCR
          Wait for memory transfer done signal
11   Jump to 15
12   Copy value from HCR into MEM(@MAR)
          Wait for memory transfer done signal
13   
14   
15   Increment PCR
